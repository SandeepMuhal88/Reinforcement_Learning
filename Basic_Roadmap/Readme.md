A structured guide to learning **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** from scratch to advanced research-level concepts.

## Module 0: Prerequisites Refresher (2 weeks)

- Python for ML: numpy, matplotlib, gymnasium, pytorch/tensorflow

- Math Essentials:

- Probability: random variables, expectation, conditional probability

- Linear Algebra: vectors, dot product, matrices, eigenvalues

- Calculus: differentiation, gradient, partial derivatives

- Statistics: variance, bias, distributions

- Optimization Basics: gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam

## 🚀 1. Foundations (Math & CS Basics)  
RL is math-heavy. Build your foundation first:  

- **Linear Algebra** → vectors, matrices, eigenvalues.  
- **Probability & Statistics** → Bayes theorem, expectation, variance.  
- **Calculus** → gradients, chain rule (needed for policy gradients).  
- **Algorithms/DSA** → dynamic programming, recursion, search.  
- **Python libraries** → NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Gymnasium.  

📌 *Mini project:* Write a Python simulation of a dice game with random agents.

## 🧩 2. RL Core Concepts  
The **heart of RL** – understand these thoroughly before moving to Deep RL.  

- Agents & Environment (interaction loop).  
- Reward Hypothesis.  
- **Markov Decision Processes (MDP):** States, Actions, Rewards, Transitions.  
- Policy (π), Value Function (V), Action-Value Function (Q).  
- Exploration vs Exploitation.  
- Bellman Equations.  

📌 *Mini project:* Implement a simple **Gridworld** environment and agent.

## 🎲 3. Classical RL Algorithms (Tabular Methods)  
Learn the building blocks of RL.  

- **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Policy Evaluation, Iteration, Value Iteration.  
- **Monte Carlo (MC):** First-visit MC, Every-visit MC.  
- **Temporal Difference (TD):** TD(0), TD(λ).  
- **Q-Learning** (off-policy) & **SARSA** (on-policy).  

📌 *Mini projects:*  
- Solve **FrozenLake-v1** using Value Iteration.  
- Solve **Taxi-v3** using Q-Learning.

## 📈 4. Function Approximation  
When state/action space grows too large:  

- Linear function approximation.  
- Neural networks as function approximators.  

📌 *Mini project:* Implement Q-learning with linear approximation on **MountainCar-v0**.

## 🤖 5. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)  
Mix RL with Deep Learning.  

- **Deep Q-Networks (DQN):** Replay buffer, Target networks, ε-greedy.  
- **Policy Gradient Methods:** REINFORCE.  
- **Actor-Critic methods:** A2C, A3C.  
- **Advanced Deep RL:** PPO, DDPG, SAC.  

📌 *Mini projects:*  
- Train a DQN agent to play **CartPole-v1**.  
- Implement PPO for **LunarLander-v2**.

## 🧠 6. Advanced & Modern RL  
Push beyond basics.  

- **Multi-Agent RL** (competitive & cooperative).  
- **Hierarchical RL** (options framework).  
- **Model-based RL** (like AlphaZero).  
- **Meta-RL / Few-shot RL**.  
- **Offline RL (Batch RL)**.  

📌 *Ambitious project:* Build an **AlphaZero-style agent** for Tic-Tac-Toe or Connect-4.

## 🛠️ 7. Practical Tools & Frameworks  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, Stable-Baselines3, Ray RLlib.  
- **Experiment tracking:** Weights & Biases (wandb).  
- **Scaling RL:** GPUs/TPUs.  

📌 *Capstone Project Ideas:*  
- RL for trading simulations.  
- RL agent for Snake game.  
- Self-driving toy car in simulation.

## 📚 8. Research & Future Exploration  
- 📖 *Book:* Sutton & Barto – *Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction*.  
- 🔬 Follow DeepMind, OpenAI, Berkeley RL papers.  
- 🎮 Experiment with custom environments (Gym, MuJoCo, Unity ML-Agents).
